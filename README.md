# Lead Power!!!!

*Lead Power* is an amazing game of fun and adventure, fun for all ages, and filled with intrigue and mystery layered over a lovingly minimalistic design. Or it will be. One day. Someday.

For now, *Lead Power* is a series of examples extending knowledge and understanding of OO concepts for Dev Bootcamp's 2016 Copperheads. Imagine a game wherein you can explore the world and collect various writing implements, each one rarer than the last, then use them to... well.... write stuff.

"Yes, how fascinating!" I hear you say. "HOW AVANT GARDE!! **HOW ON-TREND!**"

That's write. ;)
